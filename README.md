# Important Note
This mod is a **server-side** mod!  
Playing **single-player** or **hosting a server**? It's required to be installed  
Playing on a **server**? You are not required to have this downloaded.

Also: This mod requires the **Fabric API**

## About 1.0.1
1.0.1 was just a refactoring change, no new features were added. It was also the introduction of a new policy for distributing the mod.

Every update will now have its own .jar file to keep up to date with the Fabric API requirements. This helps me identify potential issues with the mod and new Minecraft/Farbic API versions.

However, each mod file will not be tied to one game version, but rather a minimum game version. i.e. you can run the 1.21 version on 1.21.1, however there may be issues with it
